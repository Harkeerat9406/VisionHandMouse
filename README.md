# ✋ Hand Gesture-Based Cursor Control

Turn your hand into a **powerful remote control** for your computer using just your webcam! 🎥💻 This application allows you to **move the cursor, click, scroll, switch browser tabs, zoom in and out, and even show the desktop**—all with simple **hand gestures**. No keyboard or mouse required! 🚀

---

## ✨ Features & Gestures

### 🎯 **Cursor Movement**

👉 **Move your index finger** freely, and the cursor will follow! Your hand acts as a **virtual mouse**, allowing smooth navigation.

### 🖱️ **Left Click**

👉 **Touch your thumb and index finger together** to perform a left-click. Keep them separated to reset the gesture and allow another click.

### 🖱️ **Right Click**

👉 **Touch your thumb and ring finger together** to perform a right-click.

### 🔍 **Zoom In & Out**

👉 **Hold your thumb and pinky close together, then move your wrist up or down** to zoom in or out.

### 🖼️ **Show Desktop**

👉 **Make a fist** to instantly show the desktop (minimizing all windows). **Open your hand again** to restore everything back!

### 🔄 **Switch Browser Tabs**

👉 **Face your palm toward the webcam** and slightly **rotate left** (wave left) to switch to the **previous tab**.
👉 Rotate **right** (wave right) to switch to the **next tab**.

⚠️ **Important:** Once a gesture is executed (like clicking or showing the desktop), you must **separate your fingers or release your fist** before performing the action again. This prevents accidental repeated inputs!
